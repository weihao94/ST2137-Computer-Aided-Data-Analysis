# Q3

## Data Import 

```{r}
t7q3 = read.table("C:/Users/Wei Hao/Desktop/ST2137/Tutorials/Data/batfail.txt", header=T)
attach(t7q3)
```

## Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test

```{r}
kruskal.test(time, group)
```

Since the p-value $= 0.0077$ for the Kruskal-Wallis test, we reject $H_0$ at the $5\%$ significance level. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to show that the time to failure are not the same for all the four groups of batteries.
