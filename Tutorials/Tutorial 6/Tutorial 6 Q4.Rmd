## Q4

### Data Import

```{r}
t6q4 <- read.table("C:/Users/Wei Hao/Desktop/ST2137/Tutorials/Data/flextime.txt",header=T,sep=" ")
attach(t6q4)
```

## Two Related Samples Nonparametric Test

```{r}
diff <- before - after

# Get number of positive signs
ncount <- sum(sign(diff[diff>0]))

# Signed test for the difference
binom.test(ncount, length(diff), 0.5)
```

We are testing $H_0: \mu_{Diff} = 0$ against $H_1: \mu_{Diff} > 0$. Since the Signed rank test p-vale $=0.1094$, we do not reject $H_0$.
